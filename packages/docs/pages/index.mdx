## Quick Start

```bash
npm install @wizard/core
# or
pnpm add @wizard/core
```

```typescript
import { createWizard } from '@wizard/core';
import { z } from 'zod';

// Define your wizard
const wizard = createWizard({
  initialStep: 'account',
  initialContext: { total: 0 },
  steps: {
    account: {
      next: ['shipping'],
      validate: (data) => {
        // Your validation logic
      }
    },
    shipping: {
      next: ['payment'],
    },
    payment: {
      next: [],
    }
  }
});
```

## Why Wizard?

### Deep Type Safety

Every aspect of your wizard is fully typed - from step IDs to data shapes to context mutations. Invalid transitions and data shapes are caught at compile time.

### Shared Context

A single typed context object shared across all steps makes complex flows simple. Update it from any step, access it everywhere.

### Framework Agnostic

The core library has zero UI dependencies. Use it with React, Vue, Svelte, or vanilla JavaScript. We provide first-class React bindings, but the patterns work everywhere.

### Production Ready

Built with TanStack Store for bulletproof state management. Includes async operations, validation, guards, persistence, and history out of the box.

## Core Concepts

- **Steps** - Define your wizard flow with typed step definitions
- **Context** - Share state across all steps with a single typed context
- **Validation** - Validate step data with Zod or custom validators  
- **Guards** - Control step entry/exit with canEnter/canExit hooks
- **Persistence** - Save and restore wizard state with pluggable adapters
- **History** - Built-in undo/redo and time-travel debugging

## Philosophy

Wizard follows the TanStack philosophy:

- **Headless** - UI agnostic, bring your own components
- **Type-first** - TypeScript is a first-class citizen
- **Minimal** - Small bundle, minimal dependencies
- **Composable** - Build complex flows from simple primitives
